# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Segmentation
This project aims to create a state-of-the-art fully automatic tumor segmentation algorithm for brain MRI scans using Neural Nets 

# Background
This project started as a minor project in my pre-final year of B.Tech.
The work mainly focuses on U-Net, but will soon extend to ResUNet as well.

# Dataset
The project uses the [Brain MRI segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation).
